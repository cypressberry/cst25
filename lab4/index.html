          <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>For this assignment, I encountered issues relating to the use of the "pre" tag in HTML in order to format
			code on the page. In order for the code to be properly rendered, I needed to break tab conventions in the HTML file which my 
			HTML prettier does not like. The problem is that indenting my code block properly results in those exact indentations being
			translated into the final website which is not ideal seeing as our site does not use the entire width of the page for content
			to begin with in order to better display our image backgrounds.
