					<h1>Lab 2 - Art 101 HTML &amp; CSS Starter</h1>
					<h1>Hello World</h1>
					<p class="intro">My partner Carly showed me the website homepage she made on Installfest day 2 and she had replaced the image of the kitten with an image from an anime we both like, super cool! The anime is called Madoka Magica and is about a young girl that struggles with making decisions on her own but ultimately is made to choose in trolley problem like scenarios to the tune of whether or not she wants to become god. we both love Madoka Magica, but we were disappointed with its spinoff, Magia Record. While the original series was a perfect mix of dark storytelling, complex characters, and thought-provoking themes, Magia Record felt like a watered-down version that couldn't capture the same magic.

						<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>Attempting to place the link to the Madoka Magica Wikipedia page under our paragraph about eachother.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>We had MAJOR problems trying to get the link to sit nicely underneath the intro paragraph. We tried every CSS attribute we could find and even considered using flexbox but ultimately desided to put it in the intro paragraph as an inline link in order to come close to what we actually wanted which was for it to be freestanding and nestled just under the intro paragraph.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Reflection</h2>
						<p>In reflection, we got super carried away making this site and even theming our VSCode editors to match Madoka's color scheme. We spent way more time than we needed to trying to fix problems that the increased scope of our project created.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="minor-section">
						<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>The result speak for itself, ultimately we were unable to position the link exactly where we imagined it going without using flexbox. However, we think it looks fine where it is now.
