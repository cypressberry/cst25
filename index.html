					<h2>About Carly</h2>
					<p>Hey! as I said my name is Carly..yes like the show. hahhaa. anyways, I wanna say I love a lot of of things, but that might take a while so I'll say some basics.
						I am a second year at University of Santa Cruz, AGPM major, I used to be in the Art major but it wasn't really my strand of art. so now I am truly enveloping myself in the gaming art world that I honestly should have began with. I love video games, I like playing them, watching them, analyzing them, etc etc etc.. 
						
						Top 3 Games --
						1. Final Fantasy VII 2. Pok√©mon Gen 5 3. cant decide yet.. get back to me.
						moving on, this will be my school website, now that you know a couple things about me take a look at my pages!! PLEASE!
					</p>
